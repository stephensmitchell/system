## Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to Contribute

- Report bugs and issues
- Propose features and improvements
- Improve documentation (including `README.md` files in `docs/`)
- Triage issues and review pull requests

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make focused, small changes with clear intent.
3. Include tests or examples when helpful (and update docs where relevant).
4. Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) under the "Unreleased" section.
5. Ensure your branch is up to date and CI (if present) passes.
6. Open a Pull Request (PR) with a clear title and description linking any related issues.

## Development Standards

- Keep PRs small and atomic; large refactors should be discussed in an issue first.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Add comments only where intent is not obvious.
- Follow the project's existing style and structure.
- Commit messages: aim for imperative tone; Conventional Commits are welcome but not required.

## Issue Reports

When filing an issue, please include:

- Version or environment details (if applicable)
- Steps to reproduce (minimal and complete)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs when relevant

## Security Issues

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities. See our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md) for private reporting instructions.
